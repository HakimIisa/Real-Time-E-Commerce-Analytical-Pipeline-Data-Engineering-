# Real-Time-E-Commerce-Analytical-Pipeline-Data-Engineering-
Architected a scalable real-time data pipeline for E-commerce telemetry, prioritizing robust communication across distributed services. Implemented proactive health checks and self-healing configurations to maintain system integrity under heavy data loads.

## System Overview

Developed a high-availability E-commerce analytics engine engineered for maximum uptime. The architecture incorporates automated health monitoring, container restart strategies, and optimized network protocols to ensure seamless data flow and high fault tolerance.

## The Technology Stack


** Kafka (Event Streaming Layer): Implemented a dual-broker Kafka cluster to serve as a high-throughput ingestion hub, facilitating the reliable transit of live data streams.


** Spark (Real-Time Computation): Leveraged Spark Structured Streaming (Python-based) to perform complex in-flight analytics, transforming raw event data into structured, actionable datasets.


** Elasticsearch (Distributed Search & Storage): Utilized Elasticsearch for high-performance indexing, enabling rapid retrieval and efficient long-term storage of processed analytical metrics.


** Kibana (Operational Intelligence): Engineered dynamic, interactive dashboards within Kibana to provide stakeholders with immediate visibility into critical e-commerce KPIs and business trends.


** Docker (Microservices Orchestration): Deployed the entire ecosystem within isolated Docker containers to guarantee environment consistency, streamline resource scaling, and simplify cross-service debugging.
